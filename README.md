# MY PORTFOLIO

**Hello!**

Throughout this course I will be developing a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This includes but not limited to:

* Samples of projects I've completed or worked/collaborated on.
* A section dedicated to myself 'About Me'.
* A section dedicated to my contact information..
* A responsive layout and appealing front end presentation. 
* Skills and certifications I obtain.
